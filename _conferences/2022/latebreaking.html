    <h2>Call for late-breaking reports</h2>

    <p>We are pleased to announce our call for late-breaking reports for the Music Encoding Conference 2022.</p>

    <p>The Music Encoding Conference is the annual meeting of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) community and all who are interested in the digital representation of music. This cross-disciplinary venue is open to and brings together members from various encoding, analysis, and music research communities, including musicologists, theorists, librarians, technologists, music scholars, teachers, and students, and provides an opportunity for learning and engaging with and from each other.</p>

    <p>The MEC 2022 will take place Thursday 19th – Sunday 22nd May, 2022, at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada. The Conference will run in hybrid mode, allowing remote attendance where travel plans are affected by the ongoing pandemic.</p>

    <p>A wealth of information about attending MEC 2022 is available from the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/conference/2022">Conference website</a>.
    
    <h4>What are late-breaking reports?</h4>

    <p>Late-breaking reports (LBR) offer submitting authors an opportunity to share new work on <a href="#topics">relevant topics</a>, with a special focus on experimental ideas, novel perspectives, early-stage research, and late-breaking developments.</p>

    <p>LBR <a href="#submission">submission requirements</a> are intended to provide a low barrier of access to community feedback, with shortened page-length prescriptions and a simplified review procedure compared to submissions to the regular conference programme.</p>
  
    <p>Following the conference, authors of accepted LBR may choose to submit camera-ready versions of their submission for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The MEC proceedings will be published under an open access license and with an individual DOI number for all papers. Note that late-breaking reports will be marked as "not peer-reviewed" in the proceedings due to the reduced LBR review process.</p>

    <a class="anchor" id="submission"></a>
    <h4>Submission</h4>
    <p>LBR submissions should be formatted in A4 size with 2.5cm margins, font size 12, single space, justified, in a sans-serif typeface (e.g. Calibri) according to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mec22-lbr-template">MEC 2022 LBR Submission Template</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Length:</strong> Up to 2 pages (including figures and tables, but excluding references).</li>
      <li><strong>Submission process:</strong> The LBR submission process will open on April 3rd, 2022, with submissions accepted until capacity is reached (latest date: April 19th). Submissions should be uploaded during this window via the <a href="http://www.conftool.net/music-encoding2022">MEC '22 ConfTool website</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Review process:</strong> Submissions will be lightly reviewed for relevance to the conference (see <a href="#topics">Topics</a>) and accepted in limited numbers based on the order in which they are received.</li>
    </ul>
  <p> Please note the deadlines for the submission process outlined under <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> below. </p>

    Additional information
  </h4>

  <p>
  While we look forward to welcoming as many of you as possible in person at Dalhousie University, we are preparing for MEC ‘22 within the context of ongoing uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To allow the community to best accommodate to this situation, we are organising this year’s conference with the following commitments in mind: 
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The conference will allow remote participation as in the previous years (MEC ‘20 and ‘21). Decisions on the precise implementation of this year’s hybrid format will be announced in due course and communicated widely (conference web page, mailing list, MEI Slack, Twitter) in the months leading up to the event.
    </li>
    <li>
      We commit to the announced dates for MEC ‘22 (19th-22nd May). There will be no rescheduling of the conference to fit projected changes in the pandemic situation this year.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  Additional details regarding registration, accommodation, travel, and Covid guidelines are available on the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/conference/2022/">conference web page</a>.
