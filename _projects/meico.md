[Meico](https://github.com/cemfi/meico) implements methods to convert MEI data to several other formats, making MEI encodings accessible to a variety of applications. Meico's development was part of the ZenMEM project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (2015-2019, funding code 01UG1414Aâ€“C). All MPM-related parts of meico were part of an R&D project that was funded by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation (2019-2022).
