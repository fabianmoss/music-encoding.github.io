[Verovio](https://www.verovio.org/) is a fast, portable and lightweight open-source library for engraving Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) music scores into SVG. It follows the Standard Music Font Layout specification, which makes it easy to change the music font for personalizing the appearance. Verovio supports conversion from MusicXML to MEI. Verovio is developed by the RISM Digital Center with the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation.
